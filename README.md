Welcome to the documentation of our Light Controller project’s implementation phase.
Our light controller is a ZigBee Light Link based light controller with integrated sensors for easy-of-use designed to directly control Trådfri lamps. 
Controller gets input from sensors and a website-based GUI and will control light based on configuration settings.
